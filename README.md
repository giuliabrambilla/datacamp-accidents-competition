# Reducing the number of high fatality accidents
## DataCamp competition, November 2021


### Background
You work for the road safety team within the department of transport and are looking into how they can reduce the number of major incidents. The safety team classes major incidents as fatal accidents involving 3+ casualties. They are trying to learn more about the characteristics of these major incidents so they can brainstorm interventions that could lower the number of deaths. They have asked for your assistance with answering a number of questions.

### Your challenge
Create a report that covers the following:

What time of day and what day of week do most major incidents happen?
Are there any patterns in the time of day/ day of the week when major incidents occur?
What characteristics stand out in major incidents compared with other accidents?
On what areas would you recommend the planning team focus their brainstorming efforts to reduce major incidents?
